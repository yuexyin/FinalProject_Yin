Description: This package is specifically designed to analyze electrophysiology 
    data from an experiment in my lab. Basically the experiment is about 
    investigating how chornic alcohol drinking alters the animals' brain 
    circuits. This package contains several functions that can help with
    filtering out unstable cells; ploting graphs for visualization; creating
    statistics table; and t-test. With those functions, we can save a lot of
    times and analyze data quickly without repeated coding.
