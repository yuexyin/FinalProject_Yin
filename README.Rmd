# FinalProjectYin

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of FinalProjectYin is to make the data analysis of electrophysiology 
    data from an experiment in my lab easier and faster.

## Installation

You can install the released version of FinalProjectYin from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("FinalProjectYin")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:https://github.com/yuexyin/FinalProject_Yin

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yuexyin/FinalProject_Yin")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, include=FALSE}
library(FinalProjectYin)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(flextable)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
```

```{r}
ephys <- read.csv("Ephys_Yin.csv", header = TRUE)
```

```{r}
head(ephys1 <- ephysfilter(ephys))
```

```{r}
StatsTable(ephys1, "alcohol", "water", "Cell.ID", "Voltage.threshold.mV")
```

```{r}
threshttest("Voltage.threshold.mV", ephys1)
```
What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
